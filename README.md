## Hello there!
My name is fm3chanic and this is the github account to the equally named youtube channel.

### What will you find here?
I have made it to my mission to increase the number of available color themes for text editors and terminals. Therefore the most stuff you will find in my repos, are color schemes in html format or theme files I have created.

### Current Project:
I am currently working on a project to built color schemes based on Vtubers (form of content creators) and use them for creating themes for the open source text editor Notepad++. (you can find further details in my repos)
