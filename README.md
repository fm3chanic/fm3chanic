## Hello there!
My name is fm3chanic and this is the github account to the equally named [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@fm3chanic) channel.
Only projects and work I upload on Youtube will be shared here.

### Some Information About Me:
I am working in IT in a larger coporation. My focus during work is handling the IT operative requirements of my department which includes maintenance of a sector specific CMS with a DMS integration. Therefore my focus is arround database management (SQL), loading or exctracting data or documents via API and data analytics (SQL, Python). I also do smaller development projects with the focus of automating the desktop processes, which aren't yet automated by our systems. This is done in Python, C# and unfortunately also VBA (Excel & Word...).

Outside of work I do smaller development projects, theming projects (like the current one) and I am Linux user (so you might see some themes for Linux apps in the future too).

### Current Project:
I am currently working on a project to built color schemes based on Vtubers (form of content creators) and create theme files texteditors and terminals.

You can find [further information](https://github.com/fm3chanic/vtuber_project) regarding the Vtuber project and the currently supported apps [here](https://github.com/fm3chanic/vtuber_project).<br>
You can find [HTML reference sheets](https://github.com/fm3chanic/color_schemes) for all my color themes [here](https://github.com/fm3chanic/color_schemes).
