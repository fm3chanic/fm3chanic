## Hello there!
My name is fm3chanic and this is the github account to the equally named [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@fm3chanic) channel.

### Some Information About Me:
I am working in IT in a larger coporation. My focus during work is handling the IT operative requirements of my department which includes maintenance of a sector specific CMS with a DMS integration. Therefore my focus is arround database management (SQL), loading or exctracting data or documents via API and data analytics (SQL, Python). I also do smaller development projects with the focus of automating the desktop processes, which aren't yet automated by our systems. This is done in Python, C# and unfortunately also VBA (Excel & Word...).

Outside of work I do smaller development projects, theming projects and spent time improving my skills in system maintenance.

### Current Project:
I am currently working on a project to built color schemes based on Vtubers (form of content creators) and create theme files texteditors and terminals.
